  ## The opt-in list of events to be emitted
  ## Brigade creates one or two worker pods for each webhook request so
  ## ignoring unnecessary events saves your cluster's resource.
  ## Defaults to "*" that matches any event type and action.
  ## Remove "*" and set qualified(e.g. `issue_comment:created`) or unqualified(e.g. `issue_comment`) events instead so that Brigade emit creates worker pods for those events only.

  - "*"
